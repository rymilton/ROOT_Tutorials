2b.
Terminal Commands:
	root -l (-l removes splash/welcome message)
	.x MyFirstMacro.cpp  (Can also simply do "root -l MyFirstMacro.cpp")
	.q 
2c.
	root -l
	.L MyFirstMacro.cpp
	MyFirstMacro()

3a.
	root -l
	.x MyFirstMacro.cpp
	returns "Hello World!"
3b.	
	root -l
	.x MyFirstMacro.cpp
	Results in warning: 
		"warning: Failed to call `MyFirstMacro()` to execute the macro.
		Add this function or rename the macro. Falling back to `.L`.

	Takeaway: ".x" calls the function with the same name as the macro file
3c.
	root -l
	.L MyFirstMacro.cpp
	FunctionTwo()

4a.
	root -l
	.L MyFirstMacro.cpp
	Sum(5, 2)
	outputs "(int) 7"

Note: ".x" always executes the function with the same name as the macro file AND loads all the functions.
Can do ".x MyFirstMacro.cpp" -> Outputs "Hello World!"-> can then immediately do Sum(5,2) or even MyFirstMacro() again.
