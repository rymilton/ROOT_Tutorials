# Assignment 1
## 1. Read “First Steps with ROOT”, “ROOT architecture and components”, and “ROOT macros and shared libraries” under the ROOT Manual - Basics section

## 2. Create your first macro! 
  - Call it “MyFirstMacro.cpp”. Make the main function “void MyFirstMacro()” and have it print “Hello World!”.
  - Run the macro in ROOT using “.x”, then exit ROOT
  -Run the macro in ROOT using “.L”
In the same file, make a new function called “void FunctionTwo()” and have it print “This is my second function.”
Try running the macro file in ROOT using “.x”. What is the output?
Now change the function name of “MyFirstMacro()” to “MyMacro() and try using “.x” again. What happens? (Change function name back afterwards)
Restart ROOT and obtain the correct output of FunctionTwo() using “.L”.
Finally, make a third function called “int Sum(int x, int y)” and have it return the sum of x and y
Try calling the function with any two numbers within the ROOT terminal and verify it’s correct. 

Congrats! You now know how to create and run macros and functions in ROOT.
